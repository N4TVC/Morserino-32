Work in progress 2.2.0

* Nothing so far.


Release 2.1.0

* Source code extensively refactored into smaller files for easier navigation
  and maintenance. In particular the menu subsystem was changed so new menu
  items can be added easier and without side effects.
  
* Removed "auto stop" feature and changed it into a new menu option 
  "Head Copying", which is way cooler.

* Removed some dead code.

* Now supporting SOS prosign.

* Generator mode does no longer print a white space at the beginning.
