Work-in-progress 2.1.0

* Source code extensively refactored into smaller files for easier navigation
  and maintenance. In particular the menu subsystem was changed so new menu
  items can be added easier and with fewer side effects.
  
* Removed "auto stop" feature and changed it into a new menu option 
  "Head Copying".

* Removed some dead code.
