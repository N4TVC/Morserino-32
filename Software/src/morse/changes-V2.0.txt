Changes in Version 2.0


Bug fixes:
- Time-out Option: the selection „No timeout“ did not get saved, so after restart the selection „5 minutes“ was active again. This has ben fixed now.
- Effective wpm was not correctly calculated (pointed out by kf9up). This has been fixed.
- Cleaned up a few cases where the display was not quite correct.


New features:

- Auto Stop : Stops the generating of morse characters in CW Generator and Koch Generator modes after one word (or letter group) to help with learning head copying. One word is being played (without being shown); continue by touching the paddle or clicking the black knob, and the word will be shown. Touch again to play the next word. This is enabled by setting the parameter „Auto Stop“ to On. (This feature has been contributed by Matthias Jordan, DO3JNE.)

- Option for Pausing CW generator or Echo Trainer automatically after a certain number of words or groups. There is a new parameter „Max # of words“ , that you can set to Unlimited (= default value) or to a value between 5 and 250 in steps of 5. When the specified number of words or letter groups has been generated, the Morserino-32 will pause automatically (as if you had clicked the black knob) and wait - with a touch of a paddle (or clicking the black knob) it will continue and generate the next n words.

- Snapshots: it will be possible to store up to eight snapshots of the current parameter settings in non-volatile memory. These can be quickly recalled (ans also deleted, if not need anymore). So if your are training with different settings and have to switch these parameters now all the time, you will save a lot of time by using this feature. Ig stores the current value of all parameters (but not the Koch lesson you had selected - that stays the same even when you recall a snap shot).
    - You store a snapshot by a long press of the RED button while in the parameters menu, and you recall a snapshot by a short press of the RED button while in the parameters menu. You can select a snapshot number between 1 and 8 for storage, and for recall only those numbers that have been stored. There is also the possibility to delete snapshots.

- Two virtual „channels“ for LoRa (Default and Secondary). Both operate on the same frequency, but use the LoRa „Syncword“ to create effectively two independent channels. Useful if you want to set up two independent groups within an area, eg. for training classes. Select the secondary channel by changing the parameter „LoRa Channel“.

- Support for LoRa @ 860 - 925 MHz. If such a Heltec module for the upper UHF LoRa frequencies is being used, you need to configure the Morserino by pressing the BLACK knob at startup, then you can choose 1. a band, and b. a frequency (QRG) within the band (starting with a default QRG for that band). You can also set a different frequency for the default 433 MHz module if you desire.

- Check Wifi (see below)


Other Changes:

- All WiFi functions are now available as a separate entry („WiFi Functions“) in the main menu (instead of the triple click), with the following functions underneath
    - Disp MAC Address - show MAC address of the M32 (same function as before, just relocated into main menu)
    - Config WiFi - same function as before, just relocated into main menu)
    - Check WiFi - new function: checks connectivity with the credentials you supplied; if positive, shows also the IP address
    - Upload File - same function as before, just relocated to main menu
    - Update Firmw - same function as before, just relocated to main menu

- Minor changes in the order of characters for the Koch method (to bring them better in line with Just Learn Morse Code)

- Undecodable / unrecognized characters are now displayed as * on the display

- When setting parameters (or storing / recalling snapshots) while CW Generator or Echo Trainer is active, you will have to re-start the activity when returning from the parameter menu, by touching a paddle.

- The User Manual has been overhauled, and the typography of the pdf version is a lot better now.
